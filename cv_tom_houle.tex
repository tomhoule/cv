    and Introspection products, as well as the general space of database schema
    management and the Prisma Schema Language implementation and tooling.

    Designed and shipped a new Migrate product, and drove many smaller projects to completion (performance analysis, extended database type support, testing infrastructure, …). Frequent collaboration with external stakeholders (users, framework authors, database drivers).

    TypeScript, GraphQL. Strong collaboration practices: regular pair programming, systematic, thorough code reviews, regular 1:1s, TDD, product-oriented thinking.

    Took an active part in infrastructure work (notably, migration from Heroku
    to Kubernetes, Terraform).

  \section*{Technologies \& Interests}

  Long lived interest in \textbf{databases}, mostly from a practical point of
  view: how they are implemented, how they fit in a larger system.

  A large part of my current learning efforts are going into \textbf{formal
    methods}. Decent working grasp of proof assistants (Lean, Coq, Agda) and the
  underlying theory.  Not as knowledgeable, but interested in automatic
  verification. Using this as a learning vehicle for more maths and CS, a
  tremendous source of fun and maybe something to apply in the future.

  Long time \textbf{Rust} user who saw the language and ecosystem develop
  from the very early stages. You can find more and less recent samples of my
  code on GitHub.

  Familiar and comfortable with modern development and project management
  practices, more DevOps-related concerns like infrastructure management
  (Docker, k8s, also Ansible in the past), nix, the web plaftorm, \LaTeX...
